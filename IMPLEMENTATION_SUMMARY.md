# MRSA Resistance Gene Detector - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the MRSA Resistance Gene Detector, a tool for detecting antibiotic resistance genes in Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacterial samples.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modern web application architecture with:

- **Backend**: FastAPI-based API server with sequence analysis capabilities
- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application
- **Database**: Supabase for authentication and data storage

## Backend Implementation

### Core Components

1. **FastAPI Application**
   - Main application entry point
   - Route definitions for analysis, BLAST, and authentication endpoints
   - CORS and middleware configuration

2. **Sequence Analysis Services**
   - BLAST service for sequence alignment
   - Resistance analysis service for interpreting alignment results
   - Groq service for AI-powered treatment recommendations

3. **Authentication and Database**
   - Supabase integration for user management
   - Token-based authentication
   - Database schema for storing profiles and analysis results

4. **Data Models**
   - BLAST results model
   - Resistance analysis model
   - User and authentication models

5. **Utility Functions**
   - Configuration management
   - Database initialization
   - BLAST database setup

### Key Files

- `main.py`: FastAPI application entry point
- `services/blast_service.py`: BLAST alignment functionality
- `services/resistance_analysis_service.py`: Analysis of resistance genes
- `services/groq_service.py`: AI-powered treatment recommendations
- `services/supabase_service.py`: Authentication and database operations
- `models/blast_model.py` & `models/resistance_model.py`: Data models

## Frontend Implementation

### Core Components

1. **React Application**
   - Single-page application with React Router
   - Authentication context for user management
   - React Bootstrap for UI components

2. **Pages**
   - Home page with application overview
   - Analysis page for uploading and analyzing sequences
   - Results page for viewing analysis details
   - History page for accessing past analyses
   - Login and Registration pages

3. **Components**
   - File upload component
   - Analysis result visualization
   - Navigation and layout components

4. **Services**
   - API service for backend communication
   - Supabase client for authentication

### Key Files

- `src/App.js`: Main application component with routing
- `src/context/AuthContext.js`: Authentication state management
- `src/pages/AnalysisPage.js`: Sequence upload and analysis
- `src/pages/ResultsPage.js`: Detailed analysis results
- `src/components/AnalysisResult.js`: Visualization of analysis results
- `src/components/FileUpload.js`: FASTA file upload component

## Database Schema

The application uses Supabase with the following tables:

1. **profiles**
   - User profile information
   - Linked to Supabase Auth users

2. **analysis_results**
   - Stores analysis results
   - Includes resistance status, confidence scores, and identified genes
   - Linked to user accounts

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using:

1. **Manual Deployment**
   - Separate deployment of backend and frontend
   - Configuration via environment variables

2. **Docker Deployment**
   - Docker Compose setup with backend, frontend, and BLAST database
   - Simplified deployment process

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for backend services
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for the complete application

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing and deployment
   - Docker image building and publishing

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
   - User documentation for the application

4. **Features Enhancement**
   - Support for batch analysis
   - Additional resistance gene databases
   - Enhanced visualization of alignment results
   - Integration with additional AI models for more comprehensive analysis
